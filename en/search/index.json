If you procrastinating until the last hour and realise you can\u0026rsquo;t solve the problem on time, the shame you feel when typing the text message to ask someone for help will makes you throw the phone away and panic alone.\nIf we rely on the internet to answer every small question, we miss the chance to slowly build trust with others with these questions. It is very tempting to quickly obtain the knowledge without having to admit our ignorance. Is it really the cause? Only trust begets trust, but I don\u0026rsquo;t have to trust others when asking those easy questions, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter whether they could answer them.\nOn some extreme occasion, if I am really scared about the immediate danger, I will draw on everything in sight to save myself without a second thought.\nMaybe I just don\u0026rsquo;t believe that I could get meaningful help. If I go ask about homework, instead of discussing the the answer together, they will finish the work alone and share their answers.\nOn the filp side, if someone ask me for help, I can act immediately. I may feel annoyed sometimes, but I like the feeling to be prompted to do something.\n","date":"2024-12-28T05:02:20+08:00","permalink":"https://evthron.github.io/en/tweet/hard-to-ask-for-help/","title":"Hard to ask for help"},{"content":"My workflow for uploading posts is a bit complicatated, let me explain that here.\nI use hugo (official site) to generate my site. It requries me to put the text files and images in a certain structure so that it can convert them to the website code. Then I can upload the whole piece of code to the hosting service.\nEach section of the website, like posts and gallery, are represented as a folder on my computer. If I need to have multiple language versions for the same article, I also need to put them inside the same folder.\nblog content gallery posts cardinal-ordinal index.en.md index.zh.md I don\u0026rsquo;t add files directly inside the content folder. I first prepare the conten in Joplin and use code to generate the required content structure.\nI mimic the same folder structure in Joplin using nested notebooks. Each section is a represented as a notebook in Joplin. Each article stored inside the section notebook is represented as a notebook too. It stores the notes storing the content for each language version.\nposts cardinal-ordinal 量數和序數 Cardinals and ordinals When an note is ready to pubilsh, I add a language code tag on it. In this way, I won\u0026rsquo;t accidentally publish drafts.\nThen I use python to generate the files and shell script to upload the website.\nNow for the actual code to execute the procedure. Joppy (github) is the tool for me to output the files from Joplin. It implements the Joplin API in python.\nDue to its database nature, the way how Joplin stores folders is not intuitive. The \u0026rsquo;nested\u0026rsquo; notebooks in Joplin are not actually nested. Unlike the common tree-like file structure, in Joplin, only the chlid notebooks store who their parent is, while the parent notebook has no access to its child. For instance, if I want to know which notebooks are the child of \u0026lsquo;posts\u0026rsquo;, I have to search through all the notebooks to check whether its parent is \u0026lsquo;post\u0026rsquo;. It seems that this is the \u0026lsquo;parent list\u0026rsquo; data structure, where each child is pointing to its parent.\nIt would be very time consuming if I have to check through my few hundreds unrelated notes in Joplin. I only want to check the notebooks that represent my blog sections. However, due to Joplin\u0026rsquo;s database nature, the way how Joplin stores folders is not intuitive. Unlike the common tree-like file structure, in Joplin, only the chlid notebooks store who their parent is, while the parent notebook has no access to its child.

It seems that this is the \u0026lsquo;parent list\u0026rsquo; data structure, where each child is pointing to its parent.\nNow I know how to filter the notebooks, all that\u0026rsquo;s left is the hassle of generating the actual markdown files.

No, I don\u0026rsquo;t mean making paper planes, that no fun making paper planes. What about origami? (Though technically, making paper planes is origami) I remembered when I was in primary school, our maths teacher had taught us how to craft 3D shapes out of paper pieces.\nNow as I am talking about maths, you may notice origami is very similar with constructing shapes using ruler and compass. Actually, I\u0026rsquo;ve heard origami is more powerful than ruler and compass because it can solve the unsolvable \u0026ldquo;trisect any angle\u0026rdquo; problem. When I was still holding the flier and walking, I started wondering what the basic mathematical operations of origami are. The first one could be folding a line in half, which forms the perpendicular bisector of the line. The other one might be folding an angle in half, which gave us the diagonal line. When all they do is to cut things in half, is cutting things in third even possible? I went straight to the library to find the answer.\nThe answer is stupidly simple: Just fold the line in half two times and cut out the extra segment. It\u0026rsquo;s like Columbus\u0026rsquo;s egg, my stubborn mind can\u0026rsquo;t solve it.\nBut I still wanted a technical answer. Surprisingly, there weren\u0026rsquo;t many videos talking about the maths behind origami. Oddly, I could easily learn how to trisect angles by folding paper, but not for trisecting lines, which should be a much easier task.\nSo I tried that out myself. When using ruler and compass, the knack of that problem is to cast an already trisected line onto the new line using parallel lines. But how to make parallel lines in origami? Just remember that the perpendicular line of a perpendicular line is a parallel line. Let me share my experience: To get a more accurate result, the angle between the already trisected line and the new line should be small to make it easier to fold the perpendicular lines.\n","date":"2024-06-18T01:10:39+08:00","permalink":"https://evthron.github.io/en/tweet/origami/","title":"origami"},{"content":"I want to include more colour in my practice.

They presents more examples than explanation so I still need to copy a lot more drawings of to get the most out of them. Betty Edwards - The new drawing on the right side of the brain\nA very important book for beginners. It explains the reason why people draw badly is that they only draw symbols instead of what they actually see. Anyone could draw well once they know the knack. Betty Edwards - Color : A Course in Mastering the Art of Mixing Colors\nIntroduces the important concepts about colours: colour wheels, components of colour (hue, saturation and value), and how to actually mix them. Charles Williams - Basic drawing : how to draw what you see\nDrawing doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be masterpieces, it can be a dirty doodle drawn on boring lectures. In fact, the book said you don\u0026rsquo;t have to draw what you see. Most example shown are rough sketches, which makes it beginner-friendly. Donna Krizek - Drawing and sketching secrets : 200 tips and techniques for drawing the easy way\nIntroduces a lot of advanced techniques around many traditional media. It\u0026rsquo;s examples are all masterpieces so it\u0026rsquo;s not very useful to me yet. Gilles Ronin - Le dessin en perspective a main levee\nIntroduces the mathematical knowledge behind the construction of accurate shapes, shadows and perspective. It\u0026rsquo;s very interesting to learn the principles but not very useful to me for now since I don\u0026rsquo;t need this kind of precision. James Hobbs - Sketch Your World\nGiving me the idea of outdoor sketching, which is much more interesting than drawing indoors. To me, drawing is the best way to spend outdoor time. Mark Kistler - You can draw in 30 days : the fun, easy way to learn to draw in one month or less\nA true beginner\u0026rsquo;s book. It\u0026rsquo;s first lesson is to teach you how to draw a ball, then a cube, then a cylinder, then all the basic techniques in drawing. To me, the most brilliant technique introduced is smudging. Although any art teacher will tell you this is bad, this is much more beginner-friendly than cross-hatching, while the effect created is still stunning. Mark Kistler - You can draw it in just 30 minutes : see it and sketch it in a half-hour or less\nThe next book in the series, nothing special but still quite fun. Rudy de Reyna - How to draw what you see\nEvery object is a combination of spheres, cubes, cylinders and cones, really? R. O. Dunlop, R.A - Painting for pleasure\nIt recommends pastels as a good outdoor medium, although I later found out that it meant the powdery ones. Powdery pastels are more expensive and create a powdery mess. So I\u0026rsquo;m satisfied with the oily ones. It is another book that encourages beginners to do outdoor painting. Sam Piyasena, Beverly Philp - Just draw it!\nIt gives out lot of interesting ideas on creative art making, not bounded by traditional media. 趙巍岩, 陽佳, 楊萌 - 物我之間 : 寫生的一種方法 (Between object and subject : painting as a way to perceive and express)\nIt thoroughly discussed how should we practise drawing to learn our true styles.

Luckily, the oklch colour space separates the three elements of colours beautifully so I made use of the OKLCH colour picker and created this visually accurate colour wheel.\nParameters of the colours:\nThe 12 hues are evenly distributed, meaning they all looked distinct. Chroma = 0.12, which is the highest chroma value that doesn\u0026rsquo;t cause gaps in the hue spectrum under the sRGB colour gamut. Limited by the chroma choice, The lightness range has to be between 71-76. I chose lightness = 75. Hue Contrasting colours pairs are located at the opposite sides of the wheel, which are 180 degrees away. Pink and turquoise, red and cyan, orange and sky blue, yellow and ultramarine blue, lime and purple, and finally, green and magenta. A palate will look great if the colours used are evenly seperated, like 60 degrees (triangle) or 45 degress (square) from each other.\nLightness On this wheel, all the colours are adjusted to the same lightness. This cures our colour bias.\nWe thought colour have meanings but some of those are due to their innate lightness. We may thought yellow is happy and joyful but that\u0026rsquo;s just because yellow is brightest when saturated. Similarly, we may thought blue is calm and melancholic but that just because blue is darkest when saturated. from this colour wheel, we learnt that \u0026lsquo;gloomy yellow\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;joyful blue\u0026rsquo; exist although they not as colourful.\nUsing colours with equal lightness, we can create a mystic and almost unnerving effect, the colours are almost like glowing at the boundaries, as presented in the following drawing.\nThis drawing is completely dull in terms of lightness. We can\u0026rsquo;t feel any sense of depth from this picture. This confuses our eyes and feels illusionary.\nNow repaint it with the preset colour palate from MS Paint. This surely looked childish, but somehow it still looks more pleasant than the above one. That because contrast in lightness are reintroduced. Chroma If we darken the computer screen, everything on the screen we see becomes darker, but the colours doesn\u0026rsquo;t change. That\u0026rsquo;s because each pixel still shows the same ratio of light frequencies.\nI made colour charts to show colours at different chroma. I haven\u0026rsquo;t find out how to use them yet but they surely looked great. It also makes me wonder what creates the bumps in this chart.\n","date":"2024-01-29T05:05:42+08:00","image":"https://evthron.github.io/zh/gallery/accurate-colour-wheel/accurate-colour-wheel_hu17557053021048497530.png","permalink":"https://evthron.github.io/en/gallery/accurate-colour-wheel/","title":"Accurate Colour Wheel"},{"content":"PC: blocking Leechblock NG A must-have blocker.

If a baby was born in 2021, how old is he in 2023? These calculations may be trivial.However, the differences between clock hour and time, year and age, and the underlying concepts of cardinals and ordinals are not so trivial.\nCardinals are more useful than ordinals. Cardinals represents the amount of objects. We can apply mathematical operations to cardinals like we combine and separate real life objects. While ordinals are just labels to represent the order of objects and we can\u0026rsquo;t apply mathematical operations on them. We can see that 2 o\u0026rsquo;clock is after 1 o\u0026rsquo;clock and 3 o\u0026rsquo;clock is after 2 o\u0026rsquo;clock but we can\u0026rsquo;t add 1 o\u0026rsquo;clock and 2 o\u0026rsquo;clock up to get 3 o\u0026rsquo;clock. This is meaningless.\nTo make use of ordinals, we often need to convert them to cardinals. There are two types of cardinal information we can get from ordinals. One is the total count of ordinals and the other one is the distance between ordinals.\nWhen we are counting objects, we care about how many objects are there. Not very coincidentally, it\u0026rsquo;s equal to the ordinal of the final object. For example, when we count apples on the table, we go on like \u0026lsquo;first apple, second apple, third apple\u0026rsquo;. If the final apple we counted is the third apple, then there are in total three apples on the table.\nOn the other hand, we want to know about the distance between ordinals. For example, from 1 o\u0026rsquo;clock to 3 o\u0026rsquo;clock, we count \u0026lsquo;1 o\u0026rsquo;clock, 2 o\u0026rsquo;clocks, 3 o\u0026rsquo;clocks\u0026rsquo;. There are three \u0026lsquo;o\u0026rsquo;clocks\u0026rsquo; in total but this is not useful. We care about how many hours have passed. 1 o\u0026rsquo;clock to 2 o\u0026rsquo;clock is one hour and 2 o\u0026rsquo;clock to 3 o\u0026rsquo;clock is another hour. Hours count the distance between the \u0026lsquo;o\u0026rsquo;clocks\u0026rsquo;. Similarly, we use \u0026lsquo;2021, 2022\u0026rsquo; to count years but we don\u0026rsquo;t care how many year names have passed. We care about the age, which is the distance between the year names. We count three year names from 2021 to 2023 but only two years have passed.\nWe get the distance between ordinals by subtracting them. 3 - 1 = 2 and 2023 - 2021 = 2. Two hours have passed and the baby is two years old. Conversely, we can add a distance to a ordinal to get the next ordinal. For example, 1 o\u0026rsquo;clock plus 2 hours equals 3 o\u0026rsquo;clock.\nAlthough the preceding calculations are for elementary school students and it seems no one has a problem with it, theoretically, we can count from any numbers and in any directions for ordinals so the conversion methods may change. This problem doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist in daily life because we always count from one in ascending order. Unfortunately, programming languages start counting from 0. So if we are not clear with these basic concepts, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to proceed.\n","date":"2024-01-20T22:43:24+08:00","image":"https://evthron.github.io/zh/posts/cardinal-ordinal/apple-clock_hu14482892738896188828.jpg","permalink":"https://evthron.github.io/en/posts/cardinal-ordinal/","title":"Cardinals and ordinals"},{"content":"I picked the colour from my newly made colour chart and the result is unexpectedly good.

We can contact anyone in the world including old friends, relatives or even strangers we\u0026rsquo;ve just met five minutes ago, by pressing a \u0026lsquo;send\u0026rsquo; button. Communication is easy. However, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t encourage us to communicate.\nAlthough instant messaging applies cutting-edge communication technologies, its design is fundamentally the same as post, which was invented one hundred and eighty1 years ago. It involves three steps: write and send the letter, wait for reply, and read the reply. Since the system is so obsolete, there\u0026rsquo;s no surprise that we feel uncomfortable using it.\nWrite what？ The first question we have to think about writing letter is, \u0026lsquo;What should I write?\u0026rsquo;. But it might surprise you that we don\u0026rsquo;t usually worry about it in real life. Conversations in real life is related to time and place. Most of the topics are trivial. This is because being in the same place strongly encourages people to communicate.\nHowever, on the Internet, people are not sharing the same physical space. So that people know that such casual conversions are not reasonable. Just like you won\u0026rsquo;t drop a letter writing only the sentence \u0026lsquo;How\u0026rsquo;s the weather today?\u0026rsquo; into the post box.\nAs a result, we are forced to prepare an actual topic to start a conversation on instant messengers, even if you just want to say hi.\nWill they reply？ Assume that we\u0026rsquo;ve already sent the letter. If it\u0026rsquo;s a normal letter, we have to wait for days. However we are using instant messengers, why would we need to wait? There are only two reasons. Either the person hasn\u0026rsquo;t read the letter, or the person doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to reply. You can never be sure. At worst case, the receiver reads the letter immediately but decides not to reply. That means you have to wait for a reply that never comes starting from the second you press the \u0026lsquo;send\u0026rsquo; button. How can that encourages us to start a conversation?\nWill I be satisfied？ Do we succeed if we\u0026rsquo;ve received the reply? Not so fast. The reply might not be satisfying since texts are not genuine. You cannot feel that you are talking to a real person through texts. How can that be the case if people in the past could have in-depth conversations through letters? That\u0026rsquo;s because we are not writing letter nowadays. We are writing dialogue line by line. The two characteristics of writing dialogue, time dilation and length contraction (just like spaceships in space), make us speculate on each other.\nFirstly, time dilation gives people enough time to carefully design their words. To put it in an extreme way, all words could be spilled out by an AI chatbot to manipulate your thoughts and feelings. This possibility sows the seed of doubt.\nSecondly, length contraction makes messages contains no emotional information. Texts excels at explaining complex ideas, but not when the length is short. By the way, emojis and emoticons are not very useful because their meaning slowly alters as people abuse them.\nImitate real-life conversation There\u0026rsquo;s still a way to make instant messaging better — imitate real-life conversation by reducing time lags. I think people who are good at instant messaging might be using these techniques already. Although writing messages takes the same form as writing a letter, we should not make them too long because it takes more time thus worsen the time dilation problem (and long messages also scare people off). We should type at the speed of talking without much thought. If your tongue slips, just correct that immediately.\nOn top of that, you should follow the manners of real-life conversation like saying goodbye properly. Don\u0026rsquo;t leave a conversation suspending.\nSpread to the world On the other hand, the Internet allows us to spread our thoughts to the whole world. Why should we be satisfied with the traditional, two-way conversation?\nSometimes, when we have thoughts to share, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to share them to a specific person. This is great because it fundamentally doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the problems of instant messaging.\nThere no need need to come up with a topic that catches others\u0026rsquo; interest. There\u0026rsquo;s no need to wait for replies. There\u0026rsquo;s no doubt for insincerity as you are writing for yourself, and you have got plenty of space to put them down. You could spread your thoughts in social media, but that\u0026rsquo;s not the best choice since you might waste more time scrolling and deal with people\u0026rsquo;s reactions. On WeChat, there\u0026rsquo;s a microblogging space called Moments (literally in Chinese: Friend Circle), which might be a good choice since your posts are limited to your friends. However, the best place to share your thought is on your personal website. Building one could be difficult if you are not a tech-savvy person.

Key combos are hard to remember and bad to our fingers. Try pressing Ctrl + Shift + P and Ctrl + Shfit + Esc everyday, even the daily-used Ctrl+C Ctrl+V are forcing us to press hard on our little fingers. We should have dedicated keys for those frequent moves.\nOn the other hand, some keys are obsolete and should have been removed. Print Screen, Scroll Lock, Pause, Insert. The entire row of function keys are mostly wasted on uncommon actions, like F1 is for opening manual that no one reads, F2 only works in file system to rename files, F4 is only useful when paired with Alt to close programs. F6 to F10 don\u0026rsquo;t even have dedicated functions, which is unacceptable.\nThankfully, those obsolete keys can become precious real estate as we can remap the key combos on them using AutoHotKey. For example, you can set F1 to F4 to be undo, copy, cut and paste respectively. Here are my AutoHotKey configurations:\nKey combos F3: Ctrl + F (Search) Browsing Delete: Ctrl + w (Close tabs) Insert: Ctrl + t (Insert new tab) Page Up: Ctrl + Shift + Tab (Switch tab: up) Page Down: Ctrl + Tab (Switch tab: down) F2: Toggle tabs list (Using extension: Tree style tab) F6: Shift + Ctrl + T （Re-open closed tabs in browser） Input CapsLock swaps with Backspace Right Alt -\u0026gt; Enter Left Alt -\u0026gt; Escape (Switch to normal mode in vim) Enter -\u0026gt; Win + Space (Switch between Chinese and English input methods) Starting software F4: Dictionary F7: Terminal F8: Text editor Although the syntax of Autohotkey scripts is hard to learn, it has everything but the kitchen sink. It can help you type hotstrings, auto-click and design macros. I recommend everyone to look into it and pick out some features they need.\nHowever, it is exclusive on Windows and I had a little bit headache to find its replacement on linux. For remapping, keyd is a simple and good enough alternative.\n","date":"2023-12-22T03:46:57+08:00","permalink":"https://evthron.github.io/en/toolbox/remap-keyboard/","title":"Remap keyboard"},{"content":"This one is reward winning!\nPrompt: a highly detailed oil painting of a cat walking in foggy london street, steampunk, gears, steam engine, by leonardo da Vinci, trending in artstation\nNegative prompt: monochrome, blurry, jpeg artifacts, worst quality, watermark\nSteps: 30\nSampler: DPM++ 2M Karras\nCFG scale: 10\nSeed: 189248350\nSize: 768x512\nModel hash: cc6cb27103\nModel: v1-5-pruned-emaonly\n","date":"2023-12-02T10:32:58+08:00","image":"https://evthron.github.io/zh/gallery/agi/london-cat_hu540022299591787024.png","permalink":"https://evthron.github.io/en/gallery/agi/","title":"AI Generated Oil Painting"},{"content":" Sketching means capturing everything you see on paper.

I had been writing diray for three years since then.\nThat is a diary with special format design. It packs 3 years\u0026rsquo; date onto 366 pages. The writer would need to loop through the book 3 times, he put the 1st year on the first row, 2nd year on the second row and the 3rd year on the third row,\nWhy are we doing this? Why not spread the 3 years on 900 pages? This mean you get to re-read your dairy once a year. Usually, once you put down your day, you never read that entry again. By revisiting your previous years entry, you will starting to realise your mistakes in your writing. Diary is a private thing and there should be any reader. But now you become the reader of your own wrining. You would learn to keep things simple and clear and avoid boring and repetitive events.\nAs a additional bonus, each pages comes with an unique question. You compare your changes in the answer. They said you could see you changes in thought each year. Ironically, for some question, thinking of an new answer becomes the intereresting part,\n","date":"2023-11-26T08:58:15+08:00","permalink":"https://evthron.github.io/en/posts/diary/","title":"Writing Diary"},{"content":"A cardboard frame is necessary for sketching.
