[{"content":"In a piano piece, only a handful of keys on the board will be played, otherwise it will sound like a mess. Composers only uses the notes from a scale in their mind. When the scale is chosen, the possible intervals that can be played are fixed. This gives character to a music piece.\nDifferent culture have their own scale to create the distinct sounding of their cultural music. Major scale and minor scale are the most common scales in modern music. the pentatonic scale give a sense of traditional and chinese music.\nPeople only pick those tried and tested, good-sounding scales, if we ignore this limitation, in theory, how many scales could have possibly exist? To better understand our question, let me give a very brief explanation to music notes.\nTo write music, we start from one note and travel to other notes by changing pitch, the pitch distance between notes is called interval. Notes that are octaves apart are in perfect harmony, making octave the most natural interval in music. To create more varieties in music, musicians further divide an octave to 12 equal intervals, each of the 1/12 portion is called a semitone. Remember, like line segments, an interval consists of two notes, so there are 13 notes in a octave.\nCounting the step sizes of major scale in semitones, it is 2-2-1-2-2-2-1, for minor scale, that sequence is 2-1-2-2-1-2-2. For each scales, we can write such sequence based on the numbers of semitones travels at each step.\nMajor: 2212221 Harmonic minor: 2122131 Natural minor: 2122122 Pentatonic: 23222 Now we can better frame our question: how many sequence are there to divided an octave, if I only allow the steps to be 1, 2 or 3 semitones?\nWe can easily notice that the sum of all intervals in a scale sums to 12. In combintorics, this is a combination with replacement problem. To count all the possible arrangements, we need to use a technique called stars and bars.\n3333 = 1 33321 = 20 333111 = 20 33 111 111 = 28 33 21 111 = 105 33 22 11 = 90 33 222 = 10 3 111 111 111 = 10 3 21 111 111 = 72 3 22 11 111 = 168 3 222 111 = 140 3 2222 1 = 30 222222 = 1 22222 11 = 21 2222 11 11 = 70 222 11 11 11 = 84 22 11 11 11 11 = 45 2 11 11 11 11 11 = 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 = 1 Total = 927 Therefore, there are in total 927 scales.\nIf we think deeper, many scales in the 927 combinations are somewhat similar. For example, major and minor actually uses the same set of notes, just different in starting position. C major and A minor both only uses the white keys, but they sound different just because the starting position is different.\nFor any sequence, we can pick any key inside that sequence as the starting position to create a new sequence. Modes are derived in this way.\nPhygian: 1222122 Dorian: 2122212 Major: 2212221 Locian: 1221222 Aeolian: 2122122 Mixolydian: 2212212 Lydian: 2221221 How many scales are there if we treat these modes as the same? It now becomes a circular permutation with repetition problem. This is not so simple as it may seem. It require Burnside\u0026rsquo;s theorem to calculate the \u0026lsquo;orbit\u0026rsquo; of each sequence.\nThe final result is 132.\n3333 = 1 33321 = (20 + 0) / 5 = 4 333111 = (20 + 4) / 6 = 4 33 111 111 = 28 + 4 / 8 = 4 33 21 111 = 105 + 0 / 7 = 15 33 22 11 = 90 + 6 / 6 = 16 33 222 = 10 + 0 / 5 = 2 3 111 111 111 = 10 + 0 / 10 = 1 3 21 111 111 = 72 + 0 / 9 = 8 3 22 11 111 = 168 + 0 / 8 = 21 3 222 111 = 140 + 0 / 7 = 20 3 2222 1 = 30 + 0 / 6 = 5 222222 = 1 22222 11 = 21 + 0 / 7 = 3 2222 11 11 = 70 + 10 / 8 = 10 222 11 11 11 = 84 + 6 / 9 = 10 22 11 11 11 11 = 45 + 5 / 10 = 5 2 11 11 11 11 11 = 11 / 11 = 1 11 11 11 11 11 11 = 1 = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 15+16+2+1+8+21+20+5+1+3+10+10+5+1+1 = 132 ","date":"2025-09-03T15:07:16+08:00","permalink":"https://evthron.github.io/en/posts/scale/","tags":["maths","music"],"title":"How many scales are there?"},{"content":"search.tsx Typescript interface define data structure class declare state that an variable exists, tell the complier not to throw error URL Get current path (e.g. /zh/posts) by window.location use URL interface to modify the URL\nconst pageURL = new URL(window.location.toString()); URLSearchParams URL.searchParams is a URLSearchParams object\npageURL.searchParams.delete(\u0026#39;keyword\u0026#39;) pageURL.searchParams.set(\u0026#39;keyword\u0026#39;, keywords); pageURL.searchParams.get(\u0026#39;keyword\u0026#39;); array query If the search parameter is an array, repeat the key for each value in the array. e.g. tag=maths\u0026amp;tag=music Set Params\npageURL.searchParams.delete(\u0026#39;tag\u0026#39;) pageURL.searchParams.append(\u0026#39;tag\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;maths\u0026#39;) pageURL.searchParams.append(\u0026#39;tag\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;maths\u0026#39;) Get Params\npageURL.searchParams.getAll(\u0026#39;tag\u0026#39;); ","date":"2025-08-10T15:03:23+08:00","permalink":"https://evthron.github.io/en/code/hugo-theme-stack/","tags":null,"title":"hugo-theme-stack"},{"content":"Structure MainActivity -\u0026gt; MainScreen -\u0026gt; MainViewModel -\u0026gt; AppDatabase -\u0026gt; Dao -\u0026gt; Entities Syntax var Mode by remember {mutableStateOf(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;)} lambda expression viewModel.getAllConversations().collectLatest { conversations = it } \u0026lsquo;Set conversations = the what the function returns\u0026rsquo; viewModel.getAllConversations().collectLatest { fetchedConversations -\u0026gt; conversations = fetchedConversations} flow Flow\u0026lt;List\u0026gt; collectLatest Compose Surface Theme modifier Scaffold topBar botttomBar padding -\u0026gt; send the padding to child objects on onDismiss onClick LaunchEffect ViewModel - interact with database - factory - Generic type, subclass of Viewmodel - \\\u0026lt;T: Viewmodel\\\u0026gt; create(MainViewModel::class.java) LaunchEffect not executed In MainScreen.kt:\n// Collect conversation data LaunchedEffect(viewMode, selectedTag) { Log.d(\u0026#34;MainScreen\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Collecting conversations: \u0026#34; + \u0026#34;viewMode=$viewMode, \u0026#34; + \u0026#34;selectedTag=$selectedTag\u0026#34; ) if (viewMode == \u0026#34;AllConversations\u0026#34;) { if (viewMode == \u0026#34;AllConversations\u0026#34;) { val conversationsFlow = selectedTag?.let { viewModel.getAllConversationsByTag(it) } if (selectedTag == null) { combine( viewModel.getAllConversations(), viewModel.getAllConversationStats(), ){ convs, stats -\u0026gt; conversations = convs } viewModel.getAllConversations().collectLatest { conversations = it Log.d(\u0026#34;MainScreen\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Updated all conversations: ${it.size} items\u0026#34;) } } else { viewModel.getAllConversationsByTag(selectedTag!!).collectLatest { conversations = it Log.d(\u0026#34;MainScreen\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Updated filtered conversations: ${it.size} items\u0026#34;) } } viewModel.getAllConversationStats().collectLatest { conversationStats = it Log.d(\u0026#34;MainScreen\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Updated conversation stats: $it\u0026#34;) } } } When any one of the collectLatest is triggered, the code after that will not run.

This is not a miracle. In fact, every exponential function grows proportionally to its own value, but not exactly. The number e just happens to be the only one to achieve this, with the help of infinitely fine-tuned digits, just like how π achieves the perfect radius-1 curvature.\nIt’s very hard to imagine an exponential index that is not an integer. How on earth can an exponential index grow continuously? Things can only multiply by themselves once, twice, but not 1.5 times. We know that we can imagine it using roots, but this is not intuitive at all.\nBut if you remember, in primary school, we also took some time to understand what multiplying by a decimal number means. It means addition in fractions. Exponentiation follows this logic but one order higher—it means multiplication in roots.\nThis makes me think: can we extend this definition one order higher? How can we go beyond exponentiation? This is the fourth-order operation: tetration.\nTetration is a tower of powers. Each number becomes a tower of powers with a height the same as itself.\nFor example, 2 becomes 2 to the 2, and 3 becomes 3 to the 3 to the 3.\nIs there a special number in the realm of tetration, like e? Maybe the number whose \u0026ldquo;tetrational rate\u0026rdquo; (whatever that means) is equal to the value of the function itself. Forget about differentiation—maybe we can define a higher-order differentiation operation. To make this happen, we need to extend the definition of tetration, just like how we extended the definitions of multiplication and exponentiation to real numbers.\nCan we extend this definition to fractions? Unfortunately, this steps into the realm of unsolved math problems. There’s no generally accepted function to extend the definition of tetration to real numbers. If tetration is not a continuous function, there’s no hope in finding its derivative.\nTo make things worse, unlike exponentiation—which models many natural phenomena aptly—tetration is a completely useless operation because it grows so fast that we run out of atoms in the universe by the time we reach the number 4. Nothing in the universe can be modeled using tetration. No one even knows how to make an analogy to demonstrate its growth rate.\n","date":"2025-05-04T03:07:53+08:00","permalink":"https://evthron.github.io/en/posts/higher-order-operation/","tags":["maths"],"title":"Higher order operation"},{"content":"Premature optimization is the root of all evil.

It requries me to put the text files and images in a certain structure so that it can convert them to the website code. Then I can upload the whole piece of code to the hosting service.\nEach section of the website, like posts and gallery, are represented as a folder on my computer. If I need to have multiple language versions for the same article, I also need to put them inside the same folder.\nblog content gallery posts cardinal-ordinal index.en.md index.zh.md I don\u0026rsquo;t add files directly inside the content folder. I first prepare the conten in Joplin and use code to generate the required content structure.\nI mimic the same folder structure in Joplin using nested notebooks. Each section is a represented as a notebook in Joplin. Each article stored inside the section notebook is represented as a notebook too. It stores the notes storing the content for each language version.\nposts cardinal-ordinal 量數和序數 Cardinals and ordinals When an note is ready to pubilsh, I add a language code tag on it. In this way, I won\u0026rsquo;t accidentally publish drafts.\nThen I use python to generate the files and shell script to upload the website.\nNow for the actual code to execute the procedure. Joppy (github) is the tool for me to output the files from Joplin. It implements the Joplin API in python.\nDue to its database nature, the way how Joplin stores folders is not intuitive. The \u0026rsquo;nested\u0026rsquo; notebooks in Joplin are not actually nested. Unlike the common tree-like file structure, in Joplin, only the chlid notebooks store who their parent is, while the parent notebook has no access to its child. For instance, if I want to know which notebooks are the child of \u0026lsquo;posts\u0026rsquo;, I have to search through all the notebooks to check whether its parent is \u0026lsquo;post\u0026rsquo;. It seems that this is the \u0026lsquo;parent list\u0026rsquo; data structure, where each child is pointing to its parent.\nIt would be very time consuming if I have to check through my few hundreds unrelated notes in Joplin.

No, I don\u0026rsquo;t mean making paper planes, that no fun making paper planes. What about origami? (Though technically, making paper planes is origami) I remembered when I was in primary school, our maths teacher had taught us how to craft 3D shapes out of paper pieces.\nNow as I am talking about maths, you may notice origami is very similar with constructing shapes using ruler and compass. Actually, I\u0026rsquo;ve heard origami is more powerful than ruler and compass because it can solve the unsolvable \u0026ldquo;trisect any angle\u0026rdquo; problem. When I was still holding the flier and walking, I started wondering what the basic mathematical operations of origami are. The first one could be folding a line in half, which forms the perpendicular bisector of the line. The other one might be folding an angle in half, which gave us the diagonal line. When all they do is to cut things in half, is cutting things in third even possible? I went straight to the library to find the answer.\nThe answer is stupidly simple: Just fold the line in half two times and cut out the extra segment. It\u0026rsquo;s like Columbus\u0026rsquo;s egg, my stubborn mind can\u0026rsquo;t solve it.\nBut I still wanted a technical answer. Surprisingly, there weren\u0026rsquo;t many videos talking about the maths behind origami. Oddly, I could easily learn how to trisect angles by folding paper, but not for trisecting lines, which should be a much easier task.\nSo I tried that out myself. When using ruler and compass, the knack of that problem is to cast an already trisected line onto the new line using parallel lines. But how to make parallel lines in origami? Just remember that the perpendicular line of a perpendicular line is a parallel line. Let me share my experience: To get a more accurate result, the angle between the already trisected line and the new line should be small to make it easier to fold the perpendicular lines.\n","date":"2024-06-18T01:10:39+08:00","permalink":"https://evthron.github.io/en/tweet/origami/","tags":["stories","maths"],"title":"origami"},{"content":"I want to include more colour in my practice.

They presents more examples than explanation so I still need to copy a lot more drawings of to get the most out of them. Betty Edwards - The new drawing on the right side of the brain A very important book for beginners. It explains the reason why people draw badly is that they only draw symbols instead of what they actually see. Anyone could draw well once they know the knack. Betty Edwards - Color : A Course in Mastering the Art of Mixing Colors Introduces the important concepts about colours: colour wheels, components of colour (hue, saturation and value), and how to actually mix them. Charles Williams - Basic drawing : how to draw what you see Drawing doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be masterpieces, it can be a dirty doodle drawn on boring lectures. In fact, the book said you don\u0026rsquo;t have to draw what you see. Most example shown are rough sketches, which makes it beginner-friendly. Donna Krizek - Drawing and sketching secrets : 200 tips and techniques for drawing the easy way Introduces a lot of advanced techniques around many traditional media. It\u0026rsquo;s examples are all masterpieces so it\u0026rsquo;s not very useful to me yet. Gilles Ronin - Le dessin en perspective a main levee Introduces the mathematical knowledge behind the construction of accurate shapes, shadows and perspective. It\u0026rsquo;s very interesting to learn the principles but not very useful to me for now since I don\u0026rsquo;t need this kind of precision. James Hobbs - Sketch Your World Giving me the idea of outdoor sketching, which is much more interesting than drawing indoors. To me, drawing is the best way to spend outdoor time. Mark Kistler - You can draw in 30 days : the fun, easy way to learn to draw in one month or less A true beginner\u0026rsquo;s book. It\u0026rsquo;s first lesson is to teach you how to draw a ball, then a cube, then a cylinder, then all the basic techniques in drawing. To me, the most brilliant technique introduced is smudging. Although any art teacher will tell you this is bad, this is much more beginner-friendly than cross-hatching, while the effect created is still stunning. Mark Kistler - You can draw it in just 30 minutes : see it and sketch it in a half-hour or less The next book in the series, nothing special but still quite fun. Rudy de Reyna - How to draw what you see Every object is a combination of spheres, cubes, cylinders and cones, really? R. O. Dunlop, R.A - Painting for pleasure It recommends pastels as a good outdoor medium, although I later found out that it meant the powdery ones. Powdery pastels are more expensive and create a powdery mess. So I\u0026rsquo;m satisfied with the oily ones. It is another book that encourages beginners to do outdoor painting. Sam Piyasena, Beverly Philp - Just draw it! It gives out lot of interesting ideas on creative art making, not bounded by traditional media. 趙巍岩, 陽佳, 楊萌 - Between object and subject : painting as a way to perceive and express It thoroughly discussed how should we practise drawing to learn our true styles.

Luckily, the oklch colour space (oklch.com) separates the three elements of colours beautifully. Go play around with their colour picker. You will have a better understanding in colour.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a interactive color wheel I made.\nLightness (L): 0.75 Chroma (C): 0.12 Rotation: 0° Neutral Gray Lightness: 0.5 Hue Offset: 0° Download image Details about colours:\nThe 12 hues are evenly distributed, meaning they all looked distinct. But at extreme lightness or high chroma, some colours don\u0026rsquo;t exist and wheel will be forced to show the nearest colour. Chroma = 0.12 and Lightness = 75 is the highest chroma value that doesn\u0026rsquo;t cause gaps in the hue spectrum under the sRGB colour gamut. Hue Contrasting colours pairs are located at the opposite sides of the wheel, which are 180 degrees away. Pink and turquoise, red and cyan, orange and sky blue, yellow and ultramarine blue, lime and purple, and finally, green and magenta. A palate will look great if the colours used are evenly seperated, like 60 degrees (triangle) or 45 degress (square) from each other.\nLightness On this wheel, all the colours are adjusted to the same lightness. This cures our colour bias.\nWe thought colour have meanings but some of those are due to their innate lightness. We may thought yellow is happy and joyful but that\u0026rsquo;s just because yellow is brightest when saturated. Similarly, we may thought blue is calm and melancholic but that just because blue is darkest when saturated. from this colour wheel, we learnt that \u0026lsquo;gloomy yellow\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;joyful blue\u0026rsquo; exist although they not as colourful.\nUsing colours with equal lightness, we can create a mystic and almost unnerving effect, the colours are almost like glowing at the boundaries, as presented in the following drawing.\nThis drawing is completely dull in terms of lightness. We can\u0026rsquo;t feel any sense of depth from this picture. This confuses our eyes and feels illusionary.\nNow repaint it with the preset colour palate from MS Paint. This surely looked childish, but somehow it still looks more pleasant than the above one. That because contrast in lightness are reintroduced. Chroma If we darken the computer screen, everything on the screen we see becomes darker, but the colours doesn\u0026rsquo;t change. That\u0026rsquo;s because each pixel still shows the same ratio of light frequencies.\nI made colour charts to show colours at different chroma. I haven\u0026rsquo;t find out how to use them yet but they surely looked great. It also makes me wonder what creates the bumps in this chart.\nIt would be great if I can use it directly in painting software.\n","date":"2024-01-29T05:05:42+08:00","image":"https://evthron.github.io/zh/gallery/accurate-colour-wheel/accurate-colour-wheel_hu_9ce95a18f9659a4b.png","permalink":"https://evthron.github.io/en/gallery/accurate-colour-wheel/","tags":["science","art"],"title":"Accurate Colour Wheel"},{"content":"PC: blocking Leechblock NG A must-have blocker.

If a baby was born in 2021, how old is he in 2023? These calculations may be trivial.However, the differences between clock hour and time, year and age, and the underlying concepts of cardinals and ordinals are not so trivial.\nCardinals are more useful than ordinals. Cardinals represents the amount of objects. We can apply mathematical operations to cardinals like we combine and separate real life objects. While ordinals are just labels to represent the order of objects and we can\u0026rsquo;t apply mathematical operations on them. We can see that 2 o\u0026rsquo;clock is after 1 o\u0026rsquo;clock and 3 o\u0026rsquo;clock is after 2 o\u0026rsquo;clock but we can\u0026rsquo;t add 1 o\u0026rsquo;clock and 2 o\u0026rsquo;clock up to get 3 o\u0026rsquo;clock. This is meaningless.\nTo make use of ordinals, we often need to convert them to cardinals. There are two types of cardinal information we can get from ordinals. One is the total count of ordinals and the other one is the distance between ordinals.\nWhen we are counting objects, we care about how many objects are there. Not very coincidentally, it\u0026rsquo;s equal to the ordinal of the final object. For example, when we count apples on the table, we go on like \u0026lsquo;first apple, second apple, third apple\u0026rsquo;. If the final apple we counted is the third apple, then there are in total three apples on the table.\nOn the other hand, we want to know about the distance between ordinals. For example, from 1 o\u0026rsquo;clock to 3 o\u0026rsquo;clock, we count \u0026lsquo;1 o\u0026rsquo;clock, 2 o\u0026rsquo;clocks, 3 o\u0026rsquo;clocks\u0026rsquo;. There are three \u0026lsquo;o\u0026rsquo;clocks\u0026rsquo; in total but this is not useful. We care about how many hours have passed. 1 o\u0026rsquo;clock to 2 o\u0026rsquo;clock is one hour and 2 o\u0026rsquo;clock to 3 o\u0026rsquo;clock is another hour. Hours count the distance between the \u0026lsquo;o\u0026rsquo;clocks\u0026rsquo;. Similarly, we use \u0026lsquo;2021, 2022\u0026rsquo; to count years but we don\u0026rsquo;t care how many year names have passed. We care about the age, which is the distance between the year names. We count three year names from 2021 to 2023 but only two years have passed.\nWe get the distance between ordinals by subtracting them. 3 - 1 = 2 and 2023 - 2021 = 2. Two hours have passed and the baby is two years old. Conversely, we can add a distance to a ordinal to get the next ordinal. For example, 1 o\u0026rsquo;clock plus 2 hours equals 3 o\u0026rsquo;clock.\nAlthough the preceding calculations are for elementary school students and it seems no one has a problem with it, theoretically, we can count from any numbers and in any directions for ordinals so the conversion methods may change. This problem doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist in daily life because we always count from one in ascending order. Unfortunately, programming languages start counting from 0. So if we are not clear with these basic concepts, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to proceed.\n","date":"2024-01-20T22:43:24+08:00","image":"https://evthron.github.io/zh/posts/cardinal-ordinal/apple-clock_hu_126d446115129079.jpg","permalink":"https://evthron.github.io/en/posts/cardinal-ordinal/","tags":["sketch"],"title":"Cardinals and ordinals"},{"content":"I picked the colour from my newly made colour chart and the result is unexpectedly good.

We can contact anyone in the world including old friends, relatives or even strangers we\u0026rsquo;ve just met five minutes ago, by pressing a \u0026lsquo;send\u0026rsquo; button. Communication is easy. However, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t encourage us to communicate.\nAlthough instant messaging applies cutting-edge communication technologies, its design is fundamentally the same as post, which was invented one hundred and eighty1 years ago. It involves three steps: write and send the letter, wait for reply, and read the reply. Since the system is so obsolete, there\u0026rsquo;s no surprise that we feel uncomfortable using it.\nWrite what？ The first question we have to think about writing letter is, \u0026lsquo;What should I write?\u0026rsquo;. But it might surprise you that we don\u0026rsquo;t usually worry about it in real life. Conversations in real life is related to time and place. Most of the topics are trivial. This is because being in the same place strongly encourages people to communicate.\nHowever, on the Internet, people are not sharing the same physical space. So that people know that such casual conversions are not reasonable. Just like you won\u0026rsquo;t drop a letter writing only the sentence \u0026lsquo;How\u0026rsquo;s the weather today?\u0026rsquo; into the post box.\nAs a result, we are forced to prepare an actual topic to start a conversation on instant messengers, even if you just want to say hi.\nWill they reply？ Assume that we\u0026rsquo;ve already sent the letter. If it\u0026rsquo;s a normal letter, we have to wait for days. However we are using instant messengers, why would we need to wait? There are only two reasons. Either the person hasn\u0026rsquo;t read the letter, or the person doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to reply. You can never be sure. At worst case, the receiver reads the letter immediately but decides not to reply. That means you have to wait for a reply that never comes starting from the second you press the \u0026lsquo;send\u0026rsquo; button. How can that encourages us to start a conversation?\nWill I be satisfied？ Do we succeed if we\u0026rsquo;ve received the reply? Not so fast. The reply might not be satisfying since texts are not genuine. You cannot feel that you are talking to a real person through texts. How can that be the case if people in the past could have in-depth conversations through letters? That\u0026rsquo;s because we are not writing letter nowadays. We are writing dialogue line by line. The two characteristics of writing dialogue, time dilation and length contraction (just like spaceships in space), make us speculate on each other.\nFirstly, time dilation gives people enough time to carefully design their words. To put it in an extreme way, all words could be spilled out by an AI chatbot to manipulate your thoughts and feelings. This possibility sows the seed of doubt.\nSecondly, length contraction makes messages contains no emotional information. Texts excels at explaining complex ideas, but not when the length is short. By the way, emojis and emoticons are not very useful because their meaning slowly alters as people abuse them.\nImitate real-life conversation There\u0026rsquo;s still a way to make instant messaging better — imitate real-life conversation by reducing time lags. I think people who are good at instant messaging might be using these techniques already. Although writing messages takes the same form as writing a letter, we should not make them too long because it takes more time thus worsen the time dilation problem (and long messages also scare people off). We should type at the speed of talking without much thought. If your tongue slips, just correct that immediately.\nOn top of that, you should follow the manners of real-life conversation like saying goodbye properly. Don\u0026rsquo;t leave a conversation suspending.\nSpread to the world On the other hand, the Internet allows us to spread our thoughts to the whole world. Why should we be satisfied with the traditional, two-way conversation?\nSometimes, when we have thoughts to share, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to share them to a specific person. This is great because it fundamentally doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the problems of instant messaging.\nThere no need need to come up with a topic that catches others\u0026rsquo; interest. There\u0026rsquo;s no need to wait for replies. There\u0026rsquo;s no doubt for insincerity as you are writing for yourself, and you have got plenty of space to put them down. You could spread your thoughts in social media, but that\u0026rsquo;s not the best choice since you might waste more time scrolling and deal with people\u0026rsquo;s reactions. On WeChat, there\u0026rsquo;s a microblogging space called Moments (literally in Chinese: Friend Circle), which might be a good choice since your posts are limited to your friends. However, the best place to share your thought is on your personal website. Building one could be difficult if you are not a tech-savvy person. At least don\u0026rsquo;t lock your contents behind a login wall.\nThe first stamp, Penny Black is issued at 1840.

It abused the right little finger on pressing both enter and the far-away-from-reach backspace. It wasted a easy-to-reach spot on the useless CapsLock. Key combos are hard to remember and bad to our fingers. Try pressing Ctrl + Shift + P and Ctrl + Shfit + Esc everyday, even the daily-used Ctrl+C Ctrl+V are forcing us to press hard on our little fingers. We should have dedicated keys for those frequent moves.\nOn the other hand, some keys are obsolete and should have been removed. Print Screen, Scroll Lock, Pause, Insert. The entire row of function keys are mostly wasted on uncommon actions, like F1 is for opening manual that no one reads, F2 only works in file system to rename files, F4 is only useful when paired with Alt to close programs. F6 to F10 don\u0026rsquo;t even have dedicated functions, which is unacceptable.\nThankfully, those obsolete keys can become precious real estate as we can remap the key combos on them using AutoHotKey. For example, you can set F1 to F4 to be undo, copy, cut and paste respectively. Here are my AutoHotKey configurations:\nKey combos F3: Ctrl + F (Search) Browsing Delete: Ctrl + w (Close tabs) Insert: Ctrl + t (Insert new tab) Page Up: Ctrl + Shift + Tab (Switch tab: up) Page Down: Ctrl + Tab (Switch tab: down) F2: Toggle tabs list (Using extension: Tree style tab) F6: Shift + Ctrl + T （Re-open closed tabs in browser） Input CapsLock swaps with Backspace Right Alt -\u0026gt; Enter Left Alt -\u0026gt; Escape (Switch to normal mode in vim) Enter -\u0026gt; Win + Space (Switch between Chinese and English input methods) Starting software F4: Dictionary F7: Terminal F8: Text editor Although the syntax of Autohotkey scripts is hard to learn, it has everything but the kitchen sink. It can help you type hotstrings, auto-click and design macros. I recommend everyone to look into it and pick out some features they need.\nHowever, it is exclusive on Windows and I had a little bit headache to find its replacement on linux.
