        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://evthron.github.io/en/skill/right-sider/#keith-ferrazzi-tahl-raz---never-eat-alone--and-other-secrets-to-success-one-relationship-at-a-time&#34; &gt;Never Eat Alone&lt;/a&gt; suggests making a list to group people according to contact frequencies. Although the book recommends to stick to simple technology like pencil and paper, I still want a specialised software and I found monica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.monicahq.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Monica (official site)&lt;/a&gt; calls itself a Persoal Relationship Management (PRM) software。On the other hand, Customer Relationship Management（CRM）is for people in the business sector to mangement their customer profiles (Never eat alone is a bit business-oriented at the outset). I think it&amp;rsquo;s beneficial to go the extra mile and put the same amount of effort to manage our own networks. Monica is open-source. You can run it on local server using the docker image they provide. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks promising but after trying it, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t enphasise enough on the features that I most needed, which is to remind me to keep in touch with people. Email notification is not going to work (and I don&amp;rsquo;t have a email server for now). The tagging and sorting functions are not very handy, while the handy event reminder panel can be replaced by other calendar software. It&amp;rsquo;s usable, but there should be some simpler tools that satisfy my needs. Maybe just pure text files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The devs are working on a revised version called &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.monicahq.com/blog/chandler-is-in-beta&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Chandler (monicahq.com)&lt;/a&gt;. See how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not necessary to spend a lot of time maintaining relationships. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to dedicate hours—all you need is to contact your friends at a stable frequency. More importantly, you have to genuinely want to reach out to them. Unfortunately, this is what I lack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No tools can incentivise me to do this. All I can do for now is to keep records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acutually, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Track &amp;amp; Graph to record things for me, although it&amp;rsquo;s not specialised for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;docker is a tool for running websites. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit complicated to install that on  Windows. If you know nothing about this, it&amp;rsquo;s better to try their official service.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Hard to ask for help</title>
        <link>https://evthron.github.io/en/tweet/hard-to-ask-for-help/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to ask for help. If you procrastinating until the last hour and realise you can&amp;rsquo;t solve the problem on time, the shame you feel when typing the text message to ask someone for help will makes you throw the phone away and panic alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we rely on the internet to answer every small question, we miss the chance to slowly build trust with others with these questions. It is very tempting to quickly obtain the knowledge without having to admit our ignorance. Is it really the cause? Only trust begets trust, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have to trust others when asking those easy questions, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether they could answer them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On some extreme occasion, if I am really scared about the immediate danger, I will draw on everything in sight to save myself without a second thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I just don&amp;rsquo;t believe that I could get meaningful help. If I go ask about homework, instead of discussing the the answer together, they will finish the work alone and share their answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the filp side, if someone ask me for help, I can act immediately. I may feel annoyed sometimes, but I like the feeling to be prompted to do something.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why care about people? Reason to socialize</title>
        <link>https://evthron.github.io/en/posts/reason-to-socialize/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to think that talking to people was a waste of time. I tried to ask about their lives out of curiosity, but their life snippets didn&amp;rsquo;t benefit me in any way. Sometimes, it did give have some benefits, like they could correct my homework or invite me to events, but that made me feel like the benefits are more important than the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only changed my mind until I read the book &lt;em&gt;Getting Relationships Right&lt;/em&gt;. I realised that even though I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretending it&amp;rsquo;s not the case, I still crave connections. I usually assume that I have nothing interesting to share, but it is very gratifying if someone actually listens to what I say. On the other hand, I am usually afraid of hearing my friends&amp;rsquo; talk about their lives when they&amp;rsquo;re doing better than me, but sometimes I do get inspired by their experiences. I care about my friends because I want to build connections, not for any other concrete benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I feel more comfortable making small talk, sending and replying text messages, and eating with others if it means I can express myself and learn more about my friends&amp;rsquo; interests and aspirations. It&amp;rsquo;ll take a lot of time, and there&amp;rsquo;s no guarantee it&amp;rsquo;ll go well. But isn&amp;rsquo;t this the most rewarding hobby I could ever get?&lt;/p&gt;
