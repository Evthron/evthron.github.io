        <title>Why care about people? Reason to socialize</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to think that talking to people was a waste of time. I tried to ask about their lives out of curiosity, but their life snippets didn&amp;rsquo;t benefit me in any way. Sometimes, it did give have some benefits, like they could correct my homework or invite me to events, but that made me feel like the benefits are more important than the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only changed my mind until I read the book &lt;em&gt;Getting Relationships Right&lt;/em&gt;. I realised that even though I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretending it&amp;rsquo;s not the case, I still crave connections. I usually assume that I have nothing interesting to share, but it is very gratifying if someone actually listens to what I say. On the other hand, I am usually afraid of hearing my friends&amp;rsquo; talk about their lives when they&amp;rsquo;re doing better than me, but sometimes I do get inspired by their experiences. I care about my friends because I want to build connections, not for any other concrete benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I feel more comfortable making small talk, sending and replying text messages, and eating with others if it means I can express myself and learn more about my friends&amp;rsquo; interests and aspirations. It&amp;rsquo;ll take a lot of time, and there&amp;rsquo;s no guarantee it&amp;rsquo;ll go well. But isn&amp;rsquo;t this the most rewarding hobby I could ever get?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>origami</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I received fliers on the street, I often felt the urge to make use of it. No, I don&amp;rsquo;t mean making paper planes, that no fun making paper planes. What about origami? (Though technically, making paper planes is origami) I remembered when I was in primary school, our maths teacher had taught us how to craft 3D shapes out of paper pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now as I am talking about maths, you may notice origami is very similar with constructing shapes using ruler and compass. Actually, I&amp;rsquo;ve heard origami is more powerful than ruler and compass because it can solve the unsolvable &amp;ldquo;trisect any angle&amp;rdquo; problem. When I was still holding the flier and walking, I started wondering what the basic mathematical operations of origami are. The first one could be folding a line in half, which forms the perpendicular bisector of the line. The other one might be folding an angle in half, which gave us the diagonal line. When all they do is to cut things in half, is cutting things in third even possible? I went straight to the library to find the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is stupidly simple: Just fold the line in half two times and cut out the extra segment. It&amp;rsquo;s like Columbus&amp;rsquo;s egg, my stubborn mind can&amp;rsquo;t solve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I still wanted a technical answer. Surprisingly, there weren&amp;rsquo;t many videos talking about the maths behind origami. Oddly, I could easily learn how to trisect angles by folding paper, but not for trisecting lines, which should be a much easier task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I tried that out myself. When using ruler and compass, the knack of that problem is to cast an already trisected line onto the new line using parallel lines. But how to make parallel lines in origami? Just remember that the perpendicular line of a perpendicular line is a parallel line. Let me share my experience: To get a more accurate result, the angle between the already trisected line and the new line should be small to make it easier to fold the perpendicular lines.&lt;/p&gt;
