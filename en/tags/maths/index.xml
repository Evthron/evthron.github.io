        <title>How many scales are there?</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In a piano piece, only a handful of keys on the board will be played, otherwise it will sound like a mess. Composers only uses the notes from a scale in their mind. When the scale is chosen, the possible intervals that can be played are fixed. This gives character to a music piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different culture have their own scale to create the distinct sounding of their cultural music. Major scale and minor scale are the most common scales in modern music. the pentatonic scale give a sense of traditional and chinese music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People only pick those tried and tested, good-sounding scales, if we ignore this limitation, in theory, how many scales could have possibly exist? To better understand our question, let me give a very brief explanation to music notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To write music, we start from one note and travel to other notes by changing pitch, the pitch distance between notes is called interval. Notes that are octaves apart are in perfect harmony, making octave the most natural interval in music. To create more varieties in music, musicians further divide an octave to 12 equal intervals, each of the 1/12 portion is called a semitone. Remember, like line segments, an interval consists of two notes, so there are 13 notes in a octave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counting the step sizes of major scale in semitones, it is 2-2-1-2-2-2-1, for minor scale, that sequence is 2-1-2-2-1-2-2. For each scales, we can write such sequence based on the numbers of semitones travels at each step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Major:           2212221
Harmonic minor:  2122131
Natural minor:   2122122
Pentatonic:      23222
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we can better frame our question: how many sequence are there to divided an octave, if I only allow the steps to be 1, 2 or 3 semitones?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can easily notice that the sum of all intervals in a scale sums to 12. In combintorics, this is a combination with replacement problem. To count all the possible arrangements, we need to use a technique called stars and bars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
3333 = 1

33321 = 20
333111 = 20

33 111 111 = 28
33 21 111 = 105
33 22 11 = 90
33 222 = 10

3 111 111 111 = 10
3 21 111 111 = 72
3 22 11 111 = 168
3 222 111 = 140
3 2222 1 = 30

222222 = 1
22222 11 = 21
2222 11 11 = 70
222 11 11 11 = 84
22 11 11 11 11 = 45
2 11 11 11 11 11 = 11

11 11 11 11 11 11 = 1

Total = 927
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, there are in total 927 scales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we think deeper, many scales in the 927 combinations are somewhat similar. For example, major and minor actually uses the same set of notes, just different in starting position. C major and A minor both only uses the white keys, but they sound different just because the starting position is different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any sequence, we can pick any key inside that sequence as the starting position to create a new sequence. Modes are derived in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Phygian:    1222122
Dorian:     2122212 
Major:      2212221
Locian:     1221222
Aeolian:    2122122
Mixolydian: 2212212 
Lydian:     2221221
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;How many scales are there if we treat these modes as the same? It now becomes a circular permutation with repetition problem. This is not so simple as it may seem. It require Burnside&amp;rsquo;s theorem to calculate the &amp;lsquo;orbit&amp;rsquo; of each sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final result is 132.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;3333 = 1
33321 = (20 + 0) / 5 = 4
333111 = (20 + 4) / 6 = 4
33 111 111 = 28 + 4 / 8 = 4
33 21 111 = 105 + 0 / 7 = 15 
33 22 11 = 90 + 6 / 6 = 16
33 222 = 10 + 0 / 5 = 2
3 111 111 111 = 10 + 0 / 10 = 1
3 21 111 111 = 72 + 0 / 9 = 8 
3 22 11 111 = 168 + 0 / 8 = 21
3 222 111 = 140 + 0 / 7 = 20
3 2222 1 = 30 + 0 / 6 = 5
222222 = 1
22222 11 = 21 + 0 / 7 = 3
2222 11 11 = 70 + 10 / 8 = 10
222 11 11 11 = 84 + 6 / 9 = 10
22 11 11 11 11 = 45 + 5 / 10 = 5
2 11 11 11 11 11 = 11 / 11 = 1
11 11 11 11 11 11 = 1
= 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 15+16+2+1+8+21+20+5+1+3+10+10+5+1+1

= 132
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

        <title>Higher order operation</title>
        <link>https://evthron.github.io/en/posts/higher-order-operation/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 04 May 2025 03:07:53 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The reason why &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt; is natural is because the exponential function with base &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt; grows exactly at the rate of its own value. This is not a miracle. In fact, every exponential function grows proportionally to its own value, but not exactly. The number &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt; just happens to be the only one to achieve this, with the help of infinitely fine-tuned digits, just like how &lt;em&gt;π&lt;/em&gt; achieves the perfect radius-1 curvature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s very hard to imagine an exponential index that is not an integer. How on earth can an exponential index grow continuously? Things can only multiply by themselves once, twice, but not 1.5 times. We know that we can imagine it using roots, but this is not intuitive at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you remember, in primary school, we also took some time to understand what multiplying by a decimal number means. It means addition in fractions. Exponentiation follows this logic but one order higher—it means multiplication in roots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes me think: can we extend this definition one order higher? How can we go beyond exponentiation? This is the fourth-order operation: tetration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tetration is a tower of powers. Each number becomes a tower of powers with a height the same as itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, 2 becomes 2 to the 2, and 3 becomes 3 to the 3 to the 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a special number in the realm of tetration, like &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;? Maybe the number whose &amp;ldquo;tetrational rate&amp;rdquo; (whatever that means) is equal to the value of the function itself. Forget about differentiation—maybe we can define a higher-order differentiation operation. To make this happen, we need to extend the definition of tetration, just like how we extended the definitions of multiplication and exponentiation to real numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we extend this definition to fractions? Unfortunately, this steps into the realm of unsolved math problems. There’s no generally accepted function to extend the definition of tetration to real numbers. If tetration is not a continuous function, there’s no hope in finding its derivative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make things worse, unlike exponentiation—which models many natural phenomena aptly—tetration is a completely useless operation because it grows so fast that we run out of atoms in the universe by the time we reach the number 4. Nothing in the universe can be modeled using tetration. No one even knows how to make an analogy to demonstrate its growth rate.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>origami</title>
        <link>https://evthron.github.io/en/tweet/origami/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2024 01:10:39 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://evthron.github.io/en/tweet/origami/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I received fliers on the street, I often felt the urge to make use of it. No, I don&amp;rsquo;t mean making paper planes, that no fun making paper planes. What about origami? (Though technically, making paper planes is origami) I remembered when I was in primary school, our maths teacher had taught us how to craft 3D shapes out of paper pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now as I am talking about maths, you may notice origami is very similar with constructing shapes using ruler and compass. Actually, I&amp;rsquo;ve heard origami is more powerful than ruler and compass because it can solve the unsolvable &amp;ldquo;trisect any angle&amp;rdquo; problem. When I was still holding the flier and walking, I started wondering what the basic mathematical operations of origami are. The first one could be folding a line in half, which forms the perpendicular bisector of the line. The other one might be folding an angle in half, which gave us the diagonal line. When all they do is to cut things in half, is cutting things in third even possible? I went straight to the library to find the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is stupidly simple: Just fold the line in half two times and cut out the extra segment. It&amp;rsquo;s like Columbus&amp;rsquo;s egg, my stubborn mind can&amp;rsquo;t solve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I still wanted a technical answer. Surprisingly, there weren&amp;rsquo;t many videos talking about the maths behind origami. Oddly, I could easily learn how to trisect angles by folding paper, but not for trisecting lines, which should be a much easier task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I tried that out myself. When using ruler and compass, the knack of that problem is to cast an already trisected line onto the new line using parallel lines. But how to make parallel lines in origami? Just remember that the perpendicular line of a perpendicular line is a parallel line. Let me share my experience: To get a more accurate result, the angle between the already trisected line and the new line should be small to make it easier to fold the perpendicular lines.&lt;/p&gt;
