If a baby was born in 2021, how old is he in 2023? These calculations may be trivial.However, the differences between clock hour and time, year and age, and the underlying concepts of cardinals and ordinals are not so trivial.\nCardinals are more useful than ordinals. Cardinals represents the amount of objects. We can apply mathematical operations to cardinals like we combine and separate real life objects. While ordinals are just labels to represent the order of objects and we can\u0026rsquo;t apply mathematical operations on them. We can see that 2 o\u0026rsquo;clock is after 1 o\u0026rsquo;clock and 3 o\u0026rsquo;clock is after 2 o\u0026rsquo;clock but we can\u0026rsquo;t add 1 o\u0026rsquo;clock and 2 o\u0026rsquo;clock up to get 3 o\u0026rsquo;clock. This is meaningless.\nTo make use of ordinals, we often need to convert them to cardinals. There are two types of cardinal information we can get from ordinals. One is the total count of ordinals and the other one is the distance between ordinals.\nWhen we are counting objects, we care about how many objects are there. Not very coincidentally, it\u0026rsquo;s equal to the ordinal of the final object. For example, when we count apples on the table, we go on like \u0026lsquo;first apple, second apple, third apple\u0026rsquo;. If the final apple we counted is the third apple, then there are in total three apples on the table.\nOn the other hand, we want to know about the distance between ordinals. For example, from 1 o\u0026rsquo;clock to 3 o\u0026rsquo;clock, we count \u0026lsquo;1 o\u0026rsquo;clock, 2 o\u0026rsquo;clocks, 3 o\u0026rsquo;clocks\u0026rsquo;. There are three \u0026lsquo;o\u0026rsquo;clocks\u0026rsquo; in total but this is not useful. We care about how many hours have passed. 1 o\u0026rsquo;clock to 2 o\u0026rsquo;clock is one hour and 2 o\u0026rsquo;clock to 3 o\u0026rsquo;clock is another hour. Hours count the distance between the \u0026lsquo;o\u0026rsquo;clocks\u0026rsquo;. Similarly, we use \u0026lsquo;2021, 2022\u0026rsquo; to count years but we don\u0026rsquo;t care how many year names have passed. We care about the age, which is the distance between the year names. We count three year names from 2021 to 2023 but only two years have passed.\nWe get the distance between ordinals by subtracting them. 3 - 1 = 2 and 2023 - 2021 = 2. Two hours have passed and the baby is two years old. Conversely, we can add a distance to a ordinal to get the next ordinal. For example, 1 o\u0026rsquo;clock plus 2 hours equals 3 o\u0026rsquo;clock.\nAlthough the preceding calculations are for elementary school students and it seems no one has a problem with it, theoretically, we can count from any numbers and in any directions for ordinals so the conversion methods may change. This problem doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist in daily life because we always count from one in ascending order. Unfortunately, programming languages start counting from 0. So if we are not clear with these basic concepts, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to proceed.\n","date":"2024-01-20T22:43:24+08:00","image":"https://evthron.github.io/en/posts/cardinal-ordinal/apple-clock_hu3b404767f3095d28632507beaa2c45b9_908227_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://evthron.github.io/en/posts/cardinal-ordinal/","title":"Cardinals and ordinals"},{"content":"I picked the colour from my newly made colour chart and the result is unexpectedly good.

We can contact anyone in the world including old friends, relatives or even strangers we\u0026rsquo;ve just met five minutes ago, by pressing a \u0026lsquo;send\u0026rsquo; button. Communication is easy. However, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t encourage us to communicate.\nAlthough instant messaging applies cutting-edge communication technologies, its design is fundamentally the same as post, which was invented one hundred and eighty1 years ago. It involves three steps: write and send the letter, wait for reply, and read the reply. Since the system is so obsolete, there\u0026rsquo;s no surprise that we feel uncomfortable using it.\nWrite what？ The first question we have to think about writing letter is, \u0026lsquo;What should I write?\u0026rsquo;. But it might surprise you that we don\u0026rsquo;t usually worry about it in real life. Conversations in real life is related to time and place. Most of the topics are trivial. This is because being in the same place strongly encourages people to communicate.\nHowever, on the Internet, people are not sharing the same physical space. So that people know that such casual conversions are not reasonable. Just like you won\u0026rsquo;t drop a letter writing only the sentence \u0026lsquo;How\u0026rsquo;s the weather today?\u0026rsquo; into the post box.\nAs a result, we are forced to prepare an actual topic to start a conversation on instant messengers, even if you just want to say hi.\nWill they reply？ Assume that we\u0026rsquo;ve already sent the letter. If it\u0026rsquo;s a normal letter, we have to wait for days. However we are using instant messengers, why would we need to wait? There are only two reasons. Either the person hasn\u0026rsquo;t read the letter, or the person doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to reply. You can never be sure. At worst case, the receiver reads the letter immediately but decides not to reply. That means you have to wait for a reply that never comes starting from the second you press the \u0026lsquo;send\u0026rsquo; button. How can that encourages us to start a conversation?\nWill I be satisfied？ Do we succeed if we\u0026rsquo;ve received the reply? Not so fast. The reply might not be satisfying since texts are not genuine. You cannot feel that you are talking to a real person through texts. How can that be the case if people in the past could have in-depth conversations through letters? That\u0026rsquo;s because we are not writing letter nowadays. We are writing dialogue line by line. The two characteristics of writing dialogue, time dilation and length contraction (just like spaceships in space), make us speculate on each other.\nFirstly, time dilation gives people enough time to carefully design their words. To put it in an extreme way, all words could be spilled out by an AI chatbot to manipulate your thoughts and feelings. This possibility sows the seed of doubt.\nSecondly, length contraction makes messages contains no emotional information. Texts excels at explaining complex ideas, but not when the length is short. By the way, emojis and emoticons are not very useful because their meaning slowly alters as people abuse them.\nImitate real-life conversation There\u0026rsquo;s still a way to make instant messaging better — imitate real-life conversation by reducing time lags. I think people who are good at instant messaging might be using these techniques already. Although writing messages takes the same form as writing a letter, we should not make them too long because it takes more time thus worsen the time dilation problem (and long messages also scare people off). We should type at the speed of talking without much thought. If your tongue slips, just correct that immediately.\nOn top of that, you should follow the manners of real-life conversation like saying goodbye properly. Don\u0026rsquo;t leave a conversation suspending.\nSpread to the world On the other hand, the Internet allows us to spread our thoughts to the whole world. Why should we be satisfied with the traditional, two-way conversation?\nSometimes, when we have thoughts to share, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to share them to a specific person. This is great because it fundamentally doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the problems of instant messaging.\nThere no need need to come up with a topic that catches others\u0026rsquo; interest. There\u0026rsquo;s no need to wait for replies. There\u0026rsquo;s no doubt for insincerity as you are writing for yourself, and you have got plenty of space to put them down. You could spread your thoughts in social media, but that\u0026rsquo;s not the best choice since you might waste more time scrolling and deal with people\u0026rsquo;s reactions. On WeChat, there\u0026rsquo;s a microblogging space called Moments (literally in Chinese: Friend Circle), which might be a good choice since your posts are limited to your friends. However, the best place to share your thought is on your personal website. Building one could be difficult if you are not a tech-savvy person. At least don\u0026rsquo;t lock your contents behind a login wall.\nThe first stamp, Penny Black is issued at 1840.
