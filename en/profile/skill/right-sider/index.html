Leil Lowndes - How to talk to anyone : 92 little tricks for big success in relationships

A very practical conversation guide that helped me find the joy of small talk. Even if you were an alien from another universe, you can blend in with normal human by following those guildlines, starting from &rsquo;look into other&rsquo;s eyes&rsquo;.

Melanie Joy - Getting relationships right : how to build resilience and thrive in life, love, and work

It convinced me that I shoul seek for connection by presenting the framework of relationship. People are vastly different in their way of connceting. However, finding friends is not that hard since they only need to compatible in some aspects of connection. It explains what does it mean to be &lsquo;vulnerable&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s actually meaning is really &lsquo;do not avoid emotional risk&rsquo;.

Keith Ferrazzi, Tahl Raz - Never eat alone : and other secrets to success, one relationship at a time

Attracted me by the book title and blew my mind by promoting &lsquo;get as many friends as you can&rsquo;. Since the author is a businessman, you might think the book will tell you ways to manipulate others to benefit from relationships. Rather, you can still be very sincereto others while following his advice.
